# CameraTrap
ESP32-based camera trap with PIR sensor.

## Special thanks
Special thanks to the [me-no-dev](https://github.com/me-no-dev).  
Thanks to his code from one of his GitHub gists, I was able to add functionality to the application for streaming live view from the camera.

Another thanks to me-no-dev for the library ESPAsyncWebServer which I used to run the server on my ESP32.
