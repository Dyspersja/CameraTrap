# CameraTrap
ESP32-based camera trap with PIR sensor.

## Special thanks
Special thanks to the [me-no-dev](https://github.com/me-no-dev).  
Thanks to his code from one of his GitHub gists, I was able to add functionality to the application for live streaming the video from the camera.

The gist I mentioned earlier:
